# Lego_Robot_Project

Lego robot was our final project for engineering class. We were supposed to build a robot that could be capable of performing certain tasks.
For the final demo, our robot was supposed to navigate freely in a hallway. Moreover, it's job was to scan all the boxes and then pick up a 
box with particular barcode and bring it back to origin.
