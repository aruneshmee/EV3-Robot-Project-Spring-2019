# Lego_Robot_Project

Lego robot was our final project for engineering class. We were supposed to build a robot that could be capable of performing certain tasks.
For the final demo, our robot was supposed to navigate freely in a hallway. Moreover, it's job was to scan all the boxes and then pick up a 
box with particular barcode and bring it back to origin. 

Here are some general guidelines:

Mr. Traficant, and his HealthCare Solutions team at Harris Corporation, has drafted some very general attributes
for a record retrieving robot. These include the ability to:

1. Operate autonomously in a timely fashion.
2. Navigate indoors without the aid of GPS (Global Positioning Satellites) or other more traditional forms of
indoor navigational aids (e.g. lines).
3. Use barcode scanning techniques to quickly ascertain the contents of a file box.
4. Transport a file box back to a copy center (i.e. retrieve the box of medical records and return it to the
central processing facility for scanning).
5. Avoid collisions with humans and other objects in its path (including another robot)
